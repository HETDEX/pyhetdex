#pyhetdex

This is the readme file of `pyhetdex`. Please use
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) syntax so it can
be easily converted to html or wiki format if needed **and** remains very
readable

##Dependancies

    numpy
    scipy
    astropy

NOTE: as `pyfits` has been integrated into `astropy` and going out of support
and since the latter provides much more functionalities that the former, we do
not support pyfits.
